1. On the dashboard page, remove the users email from the Welcome message. Change it to say Dashboard
2. The recent activity on the dashbaord should be the recent activity from any and all text generated by an ai and which ai/project/role it came from and how long ago. The user should be able to click it to see the full contents of what was generated for that specific output/file contents that was generated.
3. Implement the Files page which will display the files that have been generated and allow the user to download them. It should be a long list with a max of 15 options before the user needs to scroll. There should be a search bar at the top center of the page with a filter icon option. The search bar is reactive so as the user is typing it will update the list of files to only show the ones that match the search term. It should also have a download button for each file that will download the file to the user's computer. The filter icon can be clicked to show a hovering drop down menu that dynamically loads in the names of each project in a tiny scroll view so the user can select which projects they want to see files from.
