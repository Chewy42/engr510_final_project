I will give you some errors that you will need to fix. I want you to do a step by step process to full proof fix the errors.

1. Analyze the error and make an educated guess as to what the error is and coming from.
2. Read as much context as you can about the entire system/pipeline of interactions so that you can explain the system and the error in it.
3. List out the files related to the error.
4. Make a plan to fix the error that is clear, is logically written, and follows the @AI_Instructions.md file.
5. Fix the error.
6. Create tests to ensure the fix works. Run the run_tests.sh or run_tests.bat files to test until the test suite passes.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until the error is fixed.
8. Update anything in the run.sh file that would need to be there for me to easily run the entire system.
